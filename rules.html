    <h1>What are the rules of fantasy football?</h1>
    Fantasy football is an online game where people draft, assemble,manage an imaginary team of real-life NFL players. With these chosen rosters, people compete against each other in leagues that assign point values to NPL player performance in actual football games. Because of fantasy football's open-ended setup, these designated point values can be different from league to league.Most of these rules revolve around the topics of league size, draft protocol, scoring calculations, and roster makeup/management.
    <h3>League Size</h3>
    Before a league can hold a draft, the group of potential players(called managers or owners in fantasy football) must first decide how many teams they want to have in their league.The traditional size for a fantasy football league is ten teams; difficulty of drafting and trading increases as teams are added to the league.
    <h3>Draft Protocol</h3>
    Another essential rule in fantasy football is the draft type.Fantasy football revolves around managers choosing players they think will perform well during the season.As such, some players are likely to score points than others. Because of this, there are a few main draft types that the majority of fantasy football leagues use to ensure that everyone gets a somewhat equal opportunity to pick.We have the snake draft and the linear draft; Snake drafts alternate the direction of the picks from back to front in a sepentine fashion in an effort to level the playing field for all teams. while a linear type of fantasy draft where the order of draft picks is the same in every round.
    <h3>Rosters</h3>
    Along with the draft, another important important rule in fantasy football is the roster requirements that each team must abide by during the season. In fantasy football,team managers draft whichever NFL player they think will score the most fantasy points, but they must fulfil certain positional requirements. As a result, each fantasy football team will have a specific composition of player positions in their active lineup,as well as a few on their bench.
    <h3>Waivers</h3>
    Waivers and the waiver wire is the system by which managers acquire players that are not on another in their fantasy league. A waiver is a claim that a fantasy manager makes on a player, and the waiver wire is the pool in which available players wait to be claimed. Waiver claims are submitted on Tuesday morning, and claimed players are awarded to rosters on Wednesday.
